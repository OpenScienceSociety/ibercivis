## Abstract : 

Ibercivis (www.ibercivis.es) is the national foundation of Citizen Science in Spain that promotes and supports Citizen Science experiments and studies, delivering services to the communities as well as deploying our own tools and experiences. Our main approach to public engagement is to promote the uptake of Citizen Science tools to enrich research by changing current approaches to scientific challenges and by incorporating knowledge from outside the academia. 


In the last years, we are facing a boom of Citizen Science practices all around the world. Only from Ibercivis we have deployed more than 50 experiments with over 40 different research groups from different areas of knowledge, reaching over 50.000 volunteers. Our set of experiments include volunteer computing (e.g. simulation of nuclear fusion devices using http://boinc.berkeley.edu), volunteer sensing (e.g. odour nuisances reports http://digitalearthlab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/mygeoss/results3.cfm), volunteer thinking (e.g. stem cells images analysis cellspotting.socientize.eu), participatory experiments (e.g. human behavior in dilemma dilema.ibercivis.es), or collective intelligence projects (e.g. collectivemusicexperiment.eu) among others. 


One of the main drivers of this scenario is the digitally enabled transformation of the interactions between science and society, facing an unprecedent scale of nature and range of collaborators. We find several models of public engagement in science and contributions occur individually as well as collectively, in all the steps of the scientific workflow. There is a need of having a clear picture of the situation in Europe. Addressing this at national scale, we created the Observatory of Citizen Science in Spain (www.ciencia-ciudadana.es) to monitor the growth of such initiatives, catalogue them and analyze different impacts. 


Ibercivis was promoted from the BIFI Institute of the University of Zaragoza and includes research institutions and science funders, namely MINECO, CSIC, CIEMAT, Gobierno de Aragón and Fundación Zaragoza Ciudad del Conocimiento. We are part of the steering committee of the European Citizen Science Association, linking with responsible research and innovation. Since 2012 we coordinate the European project Socientize (www.socientize.eu) which delivered the White Paper on Citizen Science for Europe, referenced as a flagship document for the Citizen Science policy making. 


In this presentation we will present a significant set of these projects and we will present their outcomes from scientific, educational, political and technological perspectives.
